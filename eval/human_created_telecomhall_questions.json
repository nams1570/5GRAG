Also, with Open RAN, when LLS (Lower Layer Split) was introduced using option 7.2x, DU will still handle the higher part of L1 functions such as channel estimation, modulation/demodulation, FEC (Forward Error Correction), so the problem is that these L1 functions are real-time, very complex and consume a lot of computing power specially in 5G compared with 4G as 5G will have higher speed and lower latency which means 5G needs more efficient HW and faster processing of L1 functions, please check the below graph. And to meet these requirements in 5G, some techniques inside these L1 functions were introduced in 5G and were not in 4G. For example, 5G is using LDPC coding instead of Turbo coding, which is used in 4G, and LDPC is more complex and requires more computation power.",

So, we are using COTS HW from any vendor and install the SW of any 5G function, like DU, on it. The problem of this approach is that the COTS HW is less efficient compared with the purpose-built HW that is built specifically for RAN. So, it is like using a normal PC that can be used for any purpose to play games compared with a gaming PC that was designed specifically for gaming\u200b. So, we need to enhance the COTS HW by offloading these complex, real-time, and compute-intensive functions from it to a HW accelerator to enhance the whole performance in 5G Cloud RAN and Open RAN.",

        "ground_truth": "HARQ feedback timing in 5G NR is critically important for correct uplink-downlink coordination.\n\nBelwo is step by step breakdown:\n\nWhen UE sends PUSCH to gNB:\n\nThe UE sends uplink data using PUSCH in a specific slot (let\u2019s call it slot N).\nThe gNB must then process this data and respond with HARQ feedback (ACK/NACK), typically via PUCCH (from UE) or DL DCI (from gNB).\nThe timing of when this feedback is sent is determined by HARQ timing configuration, which is defined at configuration time via RRC signalling, and indicated at runtime via DCI formats.\n1. Where is the HARQ feedback timing configured (gNB-side)?\n\nThe timing between PUSCH transmission and HARQ feedback is controlled by:\n\nt-UL-HARQ parameter: This defines the number of slots between the UE\u2019s PUSCH transmission and the gNB\u2019s HARQ feedback (ACK/NACK).\nIt is configured by the gNB and communicated to the UE through RRC signalling:\nIn PUSCH-Config (RRC layer):\n\nt-Ul-HARQ ::= ENUMERATED {\n\nn4, n6, n10, n16, n20, n30, \u2026\n\n}\n\nThis tells the UE that the gNB will provide feedback t slots after it sends the PUSCH.\n\n2. At runtime, where is the HARQ feedback delivered or scheduled?\n\nDL DCI Format 1_0 / 1_1 (Downlink Control Information)\n\nThe ACK/NACK for uplink HARQ is typically delivered via DL DCI Format 1_0 or 1_1 on the PDCCH.\nThe DCI can schedule:\nA new DL transmission\nOr signal HARQ feedback and scheduling decisions\nBut DCI itself doesn\u2019t explicitly state the ACK/NACK timing. Instead, the timing is predefined based on configuration (t-UL-HARQ).\n\nSo, when the gNB sends a DCI to schedule DL or UL resources, the UE uses t-UL-HARQ and slot numbering to infer when to expect or send HARQ feedback.\n\n3. Where is HARQ ACK/NACK physically sent?\n\nThe ACK/NACK is typically delivered via:\n\nPUCCH: When UE sends ACK/NACK in response to downlink data (DL HARQ).\nPDSCH + DCI (PDCCH): When gNB sends ACK/NACK for uplink HARQ (what you\u2019re asking about).\nSo in your scenario (PUSCH from UE, ACK/NACK from gNB):\n\nThe feedback is sent on the PDCCH, in the form of DCI (usually Format 1_0 or 1_1).\nBut the timing (i.e., the slot in which ACK/NACK is expected to be sent) is not explicitly in the DCI \u2014 it\u2019s based on t-UL-HARQ.",

You can transmit B1 bits to those resources for some given modulation and other configurations.\nNow lets say you have you have a transport block which undergo CRC attachment and encoding (LDPC or Polar or any other). Now after this processing you have B2 bits\n\nB2 bits need to be transmitted where you have resources for B1 bits\n\ncase 1: B2 > B1\nMeans you have less resources campared to bits you have to transmit. So what you will do, you just transmit B1 bits and skip the remaining B1-B2 bits. Knows as puncturing\n\ncase 2: B1 > B2\nMeans you have more resources compared to the bits you need to transmit. What you should do now? repeat some of the bits to fill the remaining resources. Known as repetition.",
